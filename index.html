  <p class="next4">First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but within its
    nearly 1,200
    square
    miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.

    <p class="img-text1">Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire carefully and study how it
      interacts with the

      ecosystems. This blog provides updates about fires in Yosemite. Check for current fire restrictions.</p>
